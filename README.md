This challenge was very interesting.  I use Python to merge and clean the data. I made two new columns to separate the date and the time because I didn't know if i was going to use it, I didn't but I made it. In this repository in not included the large csv that i used to work in Tableau, it was too big.

Then I use Tableau web to solve some issues. An I include my analysis in PDF.
